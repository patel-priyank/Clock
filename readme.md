# Clock

Why do you even need a Readme for a clock?

Now that the very unfunny punchline is out of the way, I wanted something to be displayed on my second monitor while I game on my first. And I did not want to install anything on my system (looking at you, screensavers).

I tried a few websites, but something always stuck out like a sore thumb. Ads, weird animations, too funky, et cetera. So, I took some time out to develop this clean and minimal digital clock. I will probably add a few more features to this, but it serves my purpose well enough.

**Upcoming features (with no ETA):**

- ~~Switch between 24-hour and 12-hour~~
- ~~Hide seconds~~
- Change timezone
- ~~Switch between dark and light theme~~

You can try the clock [here](https://patel-priyank.github.io/Clock/) (opens in the same tab), and if you have any suggestions, you can [email me](mailto:patel23priyank@gmail.com). Any and all suggestions are welcome. ðŸ˜Š
